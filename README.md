# Advanced Javascript fundamentals

## Primitive types
Primitive types cannot be mutated as the types are passed by values
Objects can be mutated as they are passed by reference

## Prototype and __proto__ property
whenever a Object is created, Javascript creates it with the dunder __proto__ property
whenever a function is created, JS creates it with .protoype proprty
***Difference***: dunder __proto__ is used in prototypal chain lookup but not .prototype property
